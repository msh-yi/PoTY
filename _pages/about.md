The Paper of the Year exercise is part of tradition in the [Jacobsen Group](https://jacobsengroup.sites.fas.harvard.edu/){:target="blank"} at [Harvard Chemistry and Chemical Biology](https://chemistry.harvard.edu/){:target="blank"}. It is the group's celebration of advances made in the past year in organic chemistry.

From group policy, the process comprises:
1. collection of all candidates into a list
2. individual study of the papers on the list and submission votes for group members' 5 favorite papers
3. the PoTY group meeting, where we discuss the top papers and ultimately select our Paper of the Year

Step 1 involves collating papers that are relevant to organic reaction chemistry, broadly defined. For key journals such as *Science*, *Nature*, *Nature Chemistry*, and *J. Am. Chem. Soc.*, all papers that fit within our research interests are included in the list. Papers from other journals are included based on group members' discretion.

The ~1500 papers in the list from Step 1 represents a human-curated body of literature that is germane to our group's research (and likely that of other groups that also focus on the development of organic catalytic methodology). 

The motivating question is: 

>***What insights can we gain from treating this list of documents as a corpus and applying statistical and semantic analysis to it?*** 

From a data science perspective, these texts form a reasonably sized corpus from which we may glean insights that may not be apparent by reading at a human chemist's levelâ€”that is, reading deeply and within a rich conceptual framework, but being limited by memory.
