**This page is under construction, so pardon the messiness**

Here's some semantic analysis on the preliminary selections from the Jacobsen Group's Paper of the Year exercise. For more information on our yearly exercise and paper selection criteria, see [About]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/about.md %}). For details about methodology used in this analysis, see [Methodology]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/methodology.md %}).

**Disclaimers:**
1. We'll try to keep to minimum commentary/interpretation, maximum observation. 
2. These techniques have their own flaws, so some skepticism is advisable especially if findings clearly disagree with expert (your) intuition/experience.
3. Just for Rule of Three

## The Basic Stuff

We selected 1379 papers this year. The breakdown by journals is:

| journal                    | count |
|----------------------------|-------|
|*Science*                     |   33  |
|*Nature*                      |   29  |
|*J. Am. Chem. Soc.*           |  491  |
|*Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.*  |  344  |
|*Chem. Sci.*  |   85  |
|*Nat. Commun.*  |   74  |
|*Org. Lett.*  |   72  |
|*ACS. Catal.*  |   61  |
|*Adv. Synth. Catal.*  |   60  |
|*Nat. Chem.*  |   53  |
|*Chem. Comm.*  |   43  |
|*Nat. Catal.*  |   17  |
|*Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA*  |   10  |
|*ACS Cent. Sci.*  |    7  |

I've made the controversial division of these journals into three groups:
1. *Science*, *Nature*
2. *J. Am. Chem. Soc.*, *Nat. Chem.*
3. everything else

This division will be helpful for some analyses.

### Word count
As a warmup, here are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violin_plot" target="_blank">violin plots</a> of the word counts of abstracts and main texts, analyzed by group. The width of the plot corresponds to frequency; the dotted lines in the plots are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartile" target="_blank">quartiles</a>.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/abs-wc-violin.png)  |  ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/text-wc-violin.png)

Nothing too surprising here, perhaps, given journal requirements for paper length etc.

## Topic modeling
From this collection of abstracts and body texts, we can apply topic modeling (a natural language processing technique) to discover "latent" topics that appear across documents. From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_model" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>:
> a topic model is a type of statistical model for discovering the abstract "topics" that occur in a collection of documents.

In our case, for instance, we might expect the topic model to discover topics (represented by groups of words) that correspond to conceptual themes like asymmetric synthesis, photoredox, electrochemistry, etc.

We apply <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_Dirichlet_allocation" target="_blank">Latent Dirichlet allocation</a>, one of the most commonly used topic modeling approaches, to the total group of abstracts and full texts, then to individual journal groups.

Here are the topics modeled for **all the abstracts**. On the left in the following visualization, the topics (30 in this case) are plotted on a two-dimensional reduction of the feature space (basically Principal Component Analysis). The closer they are, the more "similar" they are in topic space. Click or hover on a particular topic to see the keywords that are associated with the topic, and their prevalence in the corpus (i.e. the body of text). The larger the circle, the more important/prevalent a particular topic is, i.e. topic 18 is most "important," and that makes sense since it's a topic about synthetic chemistry (and therefore applies to most papers). Not only can we learn about topics that are important, we could perhaps also learn about vocabulary that was "trendy" this past year.

Here's the topic model for the **abstracts in Group 1 journals** (*Science* and *Nature*). Because there are much fewer papers in this group, the prevalences of topics are smaller. Though we could potentially learn something from the difference in topic importances.

The topic model for **all the texts**:
<iframe id="scaled-frame" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/html/text_full_lda.html" height="770" width="1250" style="border:none;" scrolling="no"></iframe>

The topic model for **texts in Group 1**:
<iframe id="scaled-frame" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/html/text_1_lda.html" height="770" width="1250" style="border:none;" scrolling="no"></iframe>

If you're interested, here are the topic models for:

- <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/html/abs_2_lda.html" target="_blank">Group 2 abstracts</a>
- <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/html/abs_3_lda.html" target="_blank">Group 3 abstracts</a>
- <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/html/text_2_lda.html" target="_blank">Group 2 texts</a>
- <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/html/text_3_lda.html" target="_blank">Group 3 texts</a>

## Geographies

For S&Gs we can plot the affiliations of all the authors on a map, as follows. Red markers correspond to Group 1 and Group 2 journals, blue markers to Group 3. When a location has multiple papers affiliated with it, all their markers overlap and therefore only one (randomly selected) paper marker is shown. Quite a few errors exist because provided addressed were incorrectly parsed, but the overall clustering pattern is probably accurate.
